chennai International Airport (IATA: MAA, ICAO: VOMM) is an international airport serving the city of Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu, India and its metropolitan area. It is located in Tirusulam, around 20 km (12 mi) southwest of the city centre. The airport is the 5th busiest airport in India, and 3rd by international traffic. It was also 49th busiest airport in Asia in 2018 making it one of the four major airports in India under the top 50 list of 2018. In financial year 2022-23, the airport handled over 18 million passengers.
The airport is served by the airport metro station of the Chennai Metro and the Tirusulam railway station of the Chennai Suburban Railway system. To cope with the passenger traffic, two new terminals, including one satellite terminal, are under construction to handle 40 million passengers per year. Once completed, it will be India's first airport to have a satellite terminal. The new satellite terminal will be connected through a four way underground walkalator for passenger movement across different terminals.Still, the Tirusulam airport complex is expected to reach saturation by 2035, with a peak capacity of 40 million passengers, and a proposal for a new greenfield airport in Parandur has been approved. Once the new airport is commissioned, both airports will be functional.
The older domestic and international blocks 2 and 3 were named after former Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu K. Kamaraj and C. N. Annadurai, respectively. It was the first airport in India to have international and domestic terminals located adjacent to each other. It was designed by Creative Group, an India-based architecture firm. The airport serves as the southern regional headquarters of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) for South India comprising the states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, and the union territories of Puducherry and Lakshadweep. In total, the airport consists of four terminals (Terminals 1-4), where Terminals 1 and 4 are used for domestic arrivals and departures and Terminal 2 for international arrivals and departures. The older Terminal 3 on Terminal 2's western side will be demolished to extend Terminal 2.

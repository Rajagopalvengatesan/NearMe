The Thiruneermalai temple complex consists of two temples, the Ranganatha Temple and the Thiruneermalai Neervanna Perumal Temple. Both are Hindu temples in Thiruneermalai, a populated place in Kovur, a town in Chengalpattu district, Tamil Nadu, India.There are two temples, one at the top of the hill and other in the foothills. In all, the temple occupies an area of 15 acres (6.1 ha), with the lower shrine covering 3 acres (1.2 ha). The presiding deity of the temple in the foothills is Neervana Perumal in standing posture. Ranganatha is the presiding deity uphill and the shrine, vimana above the sanctum is called Ranga Vimana. There are images of Trivikrama and Narasimha around the first precinct. The temple tank is called the Kshira Pushkarini and it is believed to feed the waters of Vaikuntha, and the Ocean of Milk. The Karunya Pushkarini is the second tank, which is believed to have formed from the weeping of Narasimha, who was moved by the divine prayers of Prahlada. There are two other tanks called Svarna Pushkarini and Siddha Pushkarini.
